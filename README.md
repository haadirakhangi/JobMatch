# Jobmatch-nltk
The "resume-matcher" project is a Python-based project that uses natural language processing techniques and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to compare a job description and a resume document and provide a matching score between the two. The project takes as input a job description and a resume document in text format and uses NLTK to preprocess and tokenize the text. Then, it applies a variety of text matching and similarity algorithms to compare the job description and resume, including keyword matching, cosine similarity, and others. The output of the project is a matching score, which provides an indication of how well the applicant's skills and experience align with the job requirements. This project could be useful for recruiters or hiring managers who want to quickly and objectively evaluate a large number of resumes for a particular job opening, as well as for job seekers who want to optimize their resume for a specific job.
